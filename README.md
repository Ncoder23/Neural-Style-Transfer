# Neural Style Transfer Project
### Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a neural style transfer algorithm. Neural style transfer is an innovative technique used to merge two images—a content image and a style reference image (like an artwork by a renowned artist)—so that the output image retains the content of the first image but adopts the artistic style of the second.

### How It Works
The process involves using a convolutional neural network to extract content and style features from the respective images. The algorithm then optimizes the output image to match the content statistics of the content image and the style statistics of the style reference image. This optimization results in a new image that looks like the content image but painted in the style of the style reference image.
